# Emojify

A simple app I built to learn [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) that creates 128x128 emojis/icons from a given image file


## Installation

This app makes use of packages containing native code, therefore to install packages use [elm-install](https://github.com/gdotdesign/elm-github-install).

Start local dev server with `./scripts/start`
